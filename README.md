Shellmate is a Mac Terminal companion that gives you dynamic error correction and guidance seamlessly (keeping you in your Terminal and in the flow).


## Features
**Ask questions:** Ask ShellMate with natural text about your Terminal context.

**Detect & Fix errors:** ShellMate uses your terminal history to detect & fix errors and predict which commands you’ll need next.

**Highlight text:** Highlight text to call ShellMate's "attention" to a particular issue. 

**Never switch focus:** You’ll never need to leave your Terminal. Use the `sm` shortcut to ask questions and insert AI-generated suggestions straight into your active console. 
Example: `sm “find a file?”`
