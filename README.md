git clone git@github.com:srosro/shellbuddy.git
```

Open the project in Xcode, build it, and then you will be able to run it.

### Installation: Support to run sb commands on terminal
1. Open the project in Xcode and locate the `install.sh` script under `ShellBuddyCLI`.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Drag and drop the `install.sh` script from Xcode into the terminal ![Asking Questions](examples/install_cli.png)
4. Press `Enter` to run the script. It will handle the installation process automatically.

   ```sh
   Starting installation script from /path/to/ShellBuddyCLI/install.sh...
   Installation complete. You can now use the command 'sb' system-wide.
   ```

5. If `sb` command doesnâ€™t work immediately, run:
   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

### Installation: Running FastAPI Server for Highlight Detection
1. Open the project in Xcode and locate the `install_and_run.sh` script under `ShellBuddyHighlightDetector`.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Drag and drop the `install_and_run.sh` script from Xcode into the terminal ![Executing Script](examples/fastapi/install.png).
4. Press `Enter` to run the script. It will handle the installation and start the FastAPI server.

   ```sh
   Starting server script from /path/to/ShellBuddyHighlightDetector/install_and_run.sh...
   INFO: Application startup complete.
   INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   ```

5. The FastAPI server is now running and ready to detect highlight regions on terminal screenshots. You should see an output similar to this ![Live Server](examples/fastapi/running.png).

You can minimize this server terminal. To stop the server, simply close the terminal window or hit `CTRL+C`.
